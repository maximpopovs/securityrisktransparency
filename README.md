# ✅ Cloud Security Posture & Risk Transparency Program

## 📌 Program Charter

### 1. Program Name
**Cloud Security Posture & Risk Dashboard Project**

---

### 2. Business Problem
Modern cloud environments generate large volumes of vulnerabilities, identity alerts, and incident data.  
However, organizations often lack **centralized, measurable visibility**, leading to:

- Fragmented reporting across tools and teams  
- No trend analysis or remediation accountability  
- Leadership decisions made without metrics  
- Reactive security posture instead of proactive risk reduction  

This increases risk exposure and slows remediation.

---

### 3. Objective
Build a unified security posture program that aggregates vulnerability, identity, and incident data into a Power BI dashboard, enabling:

- Data-driven risk prioritization  
- Executive visibility and accountability  
- Measurable improvements in remediation  
- Continuous reduction of high-risk exposure  

---

### 4. Expected Outcomes & Success Metrics

| Expected Outcome | KPI / Metric |
|------------------|--------------|
| Centralized visibility across data sources | Dashboard ingesting ≥ 80% of inputs |
| Faster remediation of high-risk issues | ↓ MTTR for critical vulnerabilities |
| Improved identity security | MFA adoption ≥ 95% and privileged account reviews |
| Leadership transparency | Monthly security scorecard published |
| Improved security posture | Increasing overall posture score month-over-month |

---

### 5. In-Scope / Out-of-Scope
**In-Scope**
- Vulnerability data (CSV/API/mocked)
- Identity risks (MFA, privileged/stale accounts)
- Incident metrics (MTTA/MTTR/SLA)
- Python/Azure Function ingestion
- Power BI dashboards & scorecards
- Remediation tracking and risk register

**Out-of-Scope**
- Active production incident response
- Penetration testing or infrastructure hardening
- Real corporate data (project uses simulated or anonymized input

### 6. Key Deliverables

- Power BI Dashboard (Scorecard, Vulnerability, Identity, Incident pages)
- Risk Register (CSV/Excel)
- Remediation Tracking Sheet
- Monthly Executive Scorecard
- Architecture Diagram (Azure or Local MVP)
- Program Closeout Report & Lessons Learned

---

### ✅ Summary
This program demonstrates end-to-end security program management:  
governance → data ingestion → metrics → dashboards → executive reporting → measurable posture improvement.

The project is built to showcase security leadership, cloud knowledge, data analytics, and KPI-driven risk management using Azure, Python, and Power BI.
